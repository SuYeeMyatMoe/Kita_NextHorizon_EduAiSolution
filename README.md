## 🚩 Problem Statement

**The "Post-COVID" Admin Crisis**
While the world has moved to hybrid learning, the administrative workload for teachers has doubled. They are managing physical classrooms while simultaneously juggling digital submissions, online engagement, and fragmented software tools.

* **The Gap:** Students have "super-powered" AI learning aids, while teachers are stuck using fragmented, manual tools (spreadsheets, basic LMS) that don't talk to each other.
* **The Pain:** **60%** of an educator's time is lost to grading, data entry, and formatting resources—leading to severe burnout and less time for mentorship.

---

## 💡 Solution Overview

**NextHorizon** is an all-in-one AI ecosystem designed to bridge the physical and digital classroom. It acts as an active **AI Teaching Assistant** that handles the "invisible labor" of education.

> **Target SDG:** 🌍 **Goal 4: Quality Education** (Target 4.c: Increase supply of qualified teachers).

## ✨ Key Features

### 🎓 For Teachers (The Admin Killer)
1.  **Multimodal "Glass Box" Grading**
    * Grades **PDFs, Docs, Images (Handwriting OCR)**, and even **YouTube Video Links**.
    * Provides transparent, evidence-based feedback (e.g., timestamps in videos, highlighted text in docs) so teachers trust the score.
2.  **AI Content Studio**
    * One-click generation of Quizzes, Lesson Plans, and Slide Decks.
    * **Auto-Export:** Downloads directly as `.docx`, `.csv` (Excel ready), and PowerPoint.
    * **Visual Aid Gen:** Uses `gemini-3-pro-image-preview` to generate accurate scientific/educational diagrams.
3.  **Live Hybrid Attendance**
    * Real-time QR code scanning for students.
    * Instant sync to teacher dashboard with manual override for connectivity issues.
4.  **Predictive Risk Dashboard**
    * Analyzes grade trends to flag "At-Risk" students before they drop out.

### 🎒 For Students
* **Study Buddy:** Auto-generate flashcards and summaries from the teacher's uploaded materials.
* **Deadline Manager:** Automated calendar syncing for assignments.
